AI-Driven Multi-Agent Conversational Chatbot

A sophisticated conversational chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, designed to facilitate user interaction, extract user information, and execute specific roles with precision.
Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a multi-agent conversational chatbot system using Python and the OpenAI API. The chatbot employs a trio of agents, each with distinct responsibilities: convincing the user to share information, extracting user details, and adding structured tags.

Features-
1) Real-time interactive chat-like experience.
2) Intelligent Agent 1 engages users in a convincing dialogue to encourage information sharing.
3) Agent 2 adeptly extracts crucial user data, such as name and date of birth.
4) Agent 3 tags the extracted data and adds structured metadata.
